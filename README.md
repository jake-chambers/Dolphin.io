<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Dolphin was intended to solve the issue of sending money to your peers when you don't have a data connection available or a WiFi. 
The transactions are sent over sound and received on the peers device and processed later once connected to the internet. 
Dolphin uses an API created by [Authorize.net](https://www.authorize.net/) in order to achieve a sandbox environment for money tranfers. 
Dolphin was awarded best API use at Hack Western 5.

### Built With
Dolphin was built using the following technologies:
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [Chirp.io](https://chirp.io/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

If you'd like to have Dolphin run locally on your machine (for fun or whatever), make sure you have the following prerequisites before trying to do installation.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)

### Installation

1. Once you've cloned Dolphin onto your machine, cd into the Dolphin directory and run: `npm install`. This will install all necessary dependencies.
2. Next run: `node server` in the terminal window and Dolphin should now be hosted at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
